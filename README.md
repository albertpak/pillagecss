PillageCss v 1.0.01.001
==========

PillageCSS is a powerful *small* framework designed for **serious** developers

We decided to create another CSS framework.

###WHY?

Just because we weren't happy with the ones that are out there.

###How to use this?

Just drop it into your project, whether it's inside of CSS folder where all your css files or just in a root of your project.

####Use pillagecss.css if:
* You need an unstable framework
* You need a powerful library of clean CSS code


####Don't use pillageCSS if:
* You need a framework that supplies stability
